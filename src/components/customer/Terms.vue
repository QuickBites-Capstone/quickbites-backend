        conditions.

        I agree that placing this order is a commitment to pick up the item on the same
        day. If the item is not picked up by the time the canteen closes, the customer will
        not be entitled to any refunds, nor will they be able to claim the item the following
        day. Furthermore, if the payment method is cash and the customer fails to cancel
        the order within 5-10 minutes from the time of placing it, a penalty will be
        imposed as per the stated terms and conditions.
